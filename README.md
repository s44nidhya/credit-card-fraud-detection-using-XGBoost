# XGBoost Classifier for Binary Classification

This project demonstrates a binary classification pipeline using **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting library. The goal is to preprocess a dataset, train an optimized model, and evaluate its performance using key metrics.

## Dataset
Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Features
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- ROC AUC and precision-recall analysis
- Feature importance visualization

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
